Hi boomers!
I'm a computer scientist who has fantasies from which you can get schizophrenia or there depression. In any case!

I like to deal with technical, IT stuff, especially in the field of networks. I am passionate about creating digital music and vector graphics.

If you would like to get to know me better or contact me about something, feel free to send me a private message:

If anything I don't bite, so feel free to get in touch though if you need help with anything! x)
